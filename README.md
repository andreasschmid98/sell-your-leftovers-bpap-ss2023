# Sell Your Leftovers

Sell Your Leftovers is an e-commerce online platform for selling and buying leftover-drinks, developed within the course business process application programming.

## Description

Sell Your Leftovers addresses two common issues faced by event organizers. The first issue is that it's difficult to predict how many drinks will be needed for an event, leading to unused drinks and wasted costs. The second issue is the desire to provide high-quality drinks while keeping costs low. Sell Your Leftovers solves these problems by allowing sellers to list leftover drinks for sale at a discounted price and enabling buyers to purchase them at a lower cost than usual.
